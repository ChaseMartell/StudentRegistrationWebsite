# StudentRegistrationWebsite

This project was made during my web programming class, where we learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This was one of our projects where we had to make all of the different pieces connect. I created a student registration site, where you are able to enter student information, along with delete current students in the registration.</br></br>

This was my first semester working with JavaScript, so that was the hardest portion, but it was made easier by my prior programming knowledge from my other courses.
